# tic80-typescript
A tsconfig.js, a declarations file and a build script to use Typescript in TIC-80 with ease!

## How to
- First, create and save an empty cart in TIC-80
- Edit the variables in `run.js` to fit your environment (tic executable, cart file, carts directory)
- Write some Typescript, it should compile to `build.js`
- `node run.js` to run TIC-80, inject your code, and launch the game

## Requirements

NodeJS 6+, Typescript
